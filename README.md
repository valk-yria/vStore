# vStore
**NOTE:** This is a work-in-progress, some features may not work currently. Use at your own discretion.

This is the result of what happens when I don't trust third-party modules.

vStore is a datastore wrapper designed to interface well with Roblox's datastores. This is loosely based on loleris' [ProfileService](https://github.com/MadStudioRoblox/ProfileService) module.





### Object-Oriented
Spawn new sessions and mutate data using vStore for each player/object like as if you are changing the properties of a part. 

Manage and view data in a way that's clean, efficient and readable.

### Feature-Ready
Equipped with features such as caching, datastore 2.0, and more importantly session locking, vStore ensures your games remain most up-to-date with the datastores.

### Easy to learn
vStore is heavily encapsulated and does the heavy lifting behind the scenes for you, so you only need to worry about the important things - getting datastore work done quickly and easily.

### Versatile
Why use vStore for just player data? Use it on just about anything, be it parts, objects, etc.

### Customizable
vStore is designed for versatility - customize it as you wish to suit your tastes. Want your own getter/setter functions? Write them and plug it into the module! 

vStore is also well documented for the times when you need that extra functionality, so you can add on to the module with relative ease.

### Made and used by me!
Because I use this module heavily myself, whatever patches I release will also be published for all to use. 

Any bug you find will eventually affect me too, so I try my best to fix them asap.
