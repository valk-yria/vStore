# vStore
**NOTE:** This is a work-in-progress, some features may not work currently. Use at your own discretion.

The result of what happens when you don't trust third-party modules, vStore is an object-oriented datastore wrapper designed to interface well with Roblox's datastores. This is loosely based on loleris' [ProfileService](https://github.com/MadStudioRoblox/ProfileService) module.

--------

### **Object-Oriented**
> Spawn new sessions and mutate data using vStore for each player/object like as if you are changing the properties of a part. 
> 
> Manage and view data in a way that's clean, efficient and readable.

### **Feature-Ready**
> Equipped with features such as caching, datastore 2.0, and more importantly session locking, vStore ensures your games remain most up-to-date, performant, and reliable.

### **Easy to learn**
> vStore is heavily encapsulated and does the heavy lifting behind the scenes for you, so you only need to worry about the important things - getting datastore work done quickly and cleanly.
> 
> The syntax is also designed to resemble and use syntax you're most probably familiar with, so you can get to work easily.

### **Versatile**
> Why use vStore for just player data? Use it on just about anything, be it parts, objects, etc.

### **Customizable**
> vStore is designed for versatility - customize it as you wish to suit your tastes. Want your own getter/setter functions? Write them and plug it into the module! 
> 
> vStore is also well documented for the times when you need that extra functionality, so you can add on to the module with relative ease.

### **Made and used by me!**
> Because I use this module heavily myself, whatever patches I release will also be published for all to use. 
> 
> Any bug you find will eventually affect me too, so I try my best to fix them asap.
